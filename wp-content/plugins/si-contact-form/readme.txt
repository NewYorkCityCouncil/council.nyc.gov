== Installation ==

1. Install automatically through the `Plugins`, `Add New` menu in WordPress, or upload the `si-contact-form` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. 

2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress. On the Admin screen use the Plugins side menu to select FS Contact Form to configure the forms.  

3. You must add this shortcode `[si-contact-form form='1']` in a Page, Post, or Text Widget. You can find this shortcode on the Basic Settings tab of any form. Here is how to add the shortcode: Log into your blog admin dashboard. Click `Pages`, click `Add New`, add a title to your page, enter the shortcode `[si-contact-form form='1']` in the page. Uncheck `Allow Comments`, then click `Publish`. 

4. Test an email from your form.

5. Updates are automatic. Click on "Upgrade Automatically" if prompted from the admin menu. If you ever have to manually upgrade, simply deactivate, uninstall, and repeat the installation steps with the new version.

= For best mail delivery results, be sure to properly configure the email settings on the Basic Settings tab: =

Read the following instructions and watch the YouTube video below:

Set the "Return-path address" setting to a real email address on the SAME domain as your web site. This step really is ALWAYS necessary so mail is properly identified as originating from your server. For best results the "Email To" and the "Return-path address" should ALWAYS be separate REAL email addresses on the SAME DOMAIN as your web site (don't skip this important step!).

Some people will like to set the "Email To" to a gmail.com, outlook.com, or some other webmail address (if that is what you want, go ahead and try it), but the "Return-path address" should ALWAYS be set to a real email addresses on the SAME DOMAIN as your web site. If you try a webmail address and your mail is not sending, try changing the "Email to" address to a REAL email addresses on the SAME DOMAIN as your web site. You can still deliver it to your webmail address by forwarding the email from a setting in your hosting control panel, or [configuring your webmail to fetch a mail account](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/21289?hl=en).

Next step, check this setting box:
Enable when web host requires "Mail From" strictly tied to site (don't skip this important step!).

Click "Save Changes", then test your form's mail delivery by sending a message from the form on your page. When testing your form on your page, do not fill out the email field with the same email address as the "Email To" or "Return-path address". Use a different email address because some server's security settings do not allow email to send from/to the same address.

If you have other forms in use, be sure to repeat these settings for each form.

Now your email is properly configured for best delivery. Your form Email should now be DMARC compliant for users who submit your form with yahoo, aol, comcast, or any other provider who now requires DMARC compliance.

The email you receive will appear to be from your site email address, but because the email header "Reply-to" is set as the form user's email address. You should be able to just hit reply and send email back to the real sender. Also you should see the sender's email address in the message content. So it is still possible to send mail to that address if the "Reply-to" is somehow ignored by your email program.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

[See the official FAQ at FastSecureContactForm.com](http://www.fastsecurecontactform.com/faq-wordpress-version)

= I just installed this and do not get any email from it, what could be wrong? =

[See FAQ page: How to troubleshoot email delivery](http://www.fastsecurecontactform.com/email-does-not-send)

= If I upgrade from version 3.xx, will my forms and settings be lost? =
No, it will automatic import of settings from versions 2.5.6 up to 3.xx. As long as you do not use the delete button when deactivating the plugin.
You can and should [make a backup of your forms](http://www.fastsecurecontactform.com/backup-restore-forms).

= I upgraded from version 3.xx, to 4.xx and my forms and settings did not import =

The forms should have imported. In some rare cases, they don't import. Sorry for any inconvenience. 
Update to the latest version, click the button on the Tools tab "Import forms from 3.xx version". 

More help is on this help page:
[I upgraded to 4.xx version and my forms did not import](http://www.fastsecurecontactform.com/forms-did-not-import)

= What happens during upgrade from 3.xx, where are the settings stored? =

The upgrade is run automatically only once after installing or upgrading the 4.xx version over a 3.xx versions.
The 4.xx version uses different wp options settings than 3.xx
The options settings are rows in the wp_options database table.

4.xx wp_options:
fs_contact_global,
fs_contact_form1,
fs_contact_form2,
fs_contact_form3,

3.xx wp_options:
si_contact_gb,
si_contact_form,
si_contact_form2,
si_contact_form3,
si_contact_form4,

During 4.xx install, the installation looks to see if 4.xx options are not present(first time install), and if 3.xx options are present(3.xx was installed previously), if it passes both those tests, then it runs the import code in
class-fscf-import.php

= How do I backup or restore my forms? =

On the Tools settings tab is a backup / restore tool.
The backup / restore feature can be used for backups or as a site to site transfer. You can back up ALL forms and transfer ALL forms to the same or new site using the restore feature. Or you can back up individual forms and restore them to the the same or new site replacing any one form selected during the restore. Please consider that restoring one form or ALL forms makes permanent replacements to the forms already on the site you restore them to.
Read [more about backups](http://www.fastsecurecontactform.com/backup-restore-forms)

= Is this plugin available in other languages? =

Yes. To use a translated version, you need to obtain or make the language file for it.
At this point it would be useful to read [Installing WordPress in Your Language](http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language "Installing WordPress in Your Language") from the Codex. You will need an .mo file for this plugin that corresponds with the "WPLANG" setting in your wp-config.php file. Translations are listed below -- if a translation for your language is available, all you need to do is place it in the `/wp-content/plugins/si-contact-form/languages` directory of your WordPress installation. If one is not available, and you also speak good English, please consider doing a translation yourself (see the next question).
