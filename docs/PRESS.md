# Press

The Press Division has its own site in the WordPress multisite network. This is so that editors of Press content do not have access to the content of other Divisions. This also simplifies the admin so that editors can more easily perform their tasks. The Press site uses the "NYCC Press" theme (`wp-nycc-press`), a child theme of the "New York City Council" theme (`wp-nycc`).

_Note: Super Admins have access to all network sites_

## Press Releases

In the "NYCC Press" theme, WordPress _Posts_ have been renamed _Press Releases_. They function just as regular Posts do, except that they do not use categories (they do use tags).

## Image Gallery

By selecting "All Images" in the Page Attributes > Template menu, a page will display a paginated list of all images in the Press Media Library. Page content is optional, and it will only display on the first page if it exists.
