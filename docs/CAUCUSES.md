# Caucuses

Caucuses are a custom post type, similar to pages.

### Editing a Caucus

To add/edit a Caucus, go to the main site's WordPress Admin > Caucuses.

* **Title** - should be suffixed with "Caucus" (for context on other pages & lists)
* **Excerpt** *(optional)* - appears as a subheading under the Caucuses title (the excerpt also appears in search results, which defaults to the first ~55 words of the content if the excerpt is empty)
* **Caucus Members** - set a membership status for each Council Member (Members will be grouped by their status and ordered by district number within those groups, which appear in the following order: Chair, Co-Chair, Vice Chair, Vice Co-Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, Member)
* **Order** - order by which the Caucus appears in lists (falls back to alphabetical)

### Caucuses List

A regular page using the "Caucuses List" template will display a list off all Caucuses.
