# Initiatives

Initiatives are a custom post type, similar to pages.

### Editing an Initiative

To add/edit an Initiative, go to the primary site's Admin > Initiatives.

* **Content** *(do not use without excerpt)* - if an excerpt exists, the content will appear below the featured image and excerpt; if an excerpt does not exists, the first ~55 words of the content will appear below alongside the featured image
* **Excerpt** *(required)* - appears alongside the featured image (the excerpt also appears in search results, which defaults to the first ~55 words of the content if the excerpt is empty)
* **Featured Image** - appears alongside the excerpt, acts as a link on "Initiatives List" pages
* **Order** - order by which Initiatives appear in lists
* **Initiative Link** - a button that appears underneath the excerpt
    * **Initiative URL** - a relative or absolute link to any page on the site, or an absolute link to an external initiative site (for absolute links, don't forget the `http://` or `https://`)
    * **Button Text** - the button's text

### Initiatives List

A regular page using the "Initiatives List" template will display a list off all Initiatives.
