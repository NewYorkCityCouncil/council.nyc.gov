# Reports

When you share a Council URL, Facebook or Twitter will show a preview image, title, and description for that URL.

### Defining a share image

If a Featured Image is set for a page/post/etc., Facebook and Twitter will use that image. If no Featured Image is set, there's a generic Council image as a fallback.
