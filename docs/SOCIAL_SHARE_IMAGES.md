# Social Media Share Images

When a Council URL is shared on Facebook or Twitter, a preview is generated for that URL with an image, title, and description. If a featured image is set for the page/post being shared, Facebook and Twitter will use that image. If no Featured Image is set, there's a generic Council image as a fallback.
