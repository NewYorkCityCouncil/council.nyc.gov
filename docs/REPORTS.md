# Reports

A report is a collection of pages (one parent and its children) that share a table of contents.

### Editing a report

To add/edit a report, go to the primary site's Admin > Reports.

Edit the page content as you would a regular page. The following settings will determine how the report page appears in the table of contents:

* **Excerpt** *(optional)* - appears as a subheading under the parent page title, does not display on child pages (excerpts also appear in search results, which default to the first ~55 words of the content if the excerpt is empty)
* **Attributes**
    * **Parent** - the report's front page (all child pages in a report should be set to the same parent, do not nest pages more than one level deep)
    * **Order** - order by which the page appears in the table of contents
* **TOC Before** *(optional)* - inserts a heading before the page title/label in the table of contents
* **Page Label** *(optional)* - text to display in the table of contents (by default the table of contents will show the page title)
* **Featured Image** *(optional)* - if set, appears with the title in the page header
