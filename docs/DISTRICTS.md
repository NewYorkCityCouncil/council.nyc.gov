# Districts

Each Council District has its own site in the WordPress multisite network. This is so that editors of District content do not have access to the content of other Districts or Divisions. This also simplifies the admin so that editors can more easily perform their tasks. District sites use the "NYCC District" theme (`wp-nycc-district`), a child theme of the "New York City Council" theme (`wp-nycc`).

_Note: Super Admins have access to all network sites_

## District Options

When setting up the WordPress network, a site should be created for each Council District using the `wp-nycc-district` theme. Each District site's admin requires some configuration in Settings > District Options. There you will define the following options:

* **District Number** -
* **Council Member** -
    * **Full Name** -
    * **Short Name** -
* **Short Bio** - the text that appears at the top of the District front page
* **Thumbnail** - the URL to a the Council Member's headshot
* **Party** -
* **Borough** -
* **Neighborhoods** -
* **Contact Info** -
    * **District Office** -
    * **Legislative Office** -
* **Email Address** *(optional)* -
