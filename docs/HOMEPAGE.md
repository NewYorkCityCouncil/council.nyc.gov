# Homepage

The root page of the primary site uses the `wp-nycc/front-page.php` template. This template has a regular content area followed by a featured content section and a sidebar.

## Featured Content

To add/edit/delete featured homepage content, go to the primary site's Admin > Features. When editing a Feature, you must provide the following pieces of content:

* **Title** - the link's text
* **URL** - a relative or absolute link to any page on the site, or an absolute link to an external initiative site (for absolute links, don't forget the `http://` or `https://`)
* **Order** - the order by which Features are listed
* **Featured Image** - the background image of the link
