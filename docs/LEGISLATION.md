# Legislation

The Legislation Division has its own site in the WordPress multisite network. This is so that editors of Legislation content do not have access to the content of other Divisions. This also simplifies the admin so that editors can more easily perform their tasks. The Legislation site uses the "NYCC Legislation" theme (`wp-nycc-legislation`), a child theme of the "New York City Council" theme (`wp-nycc`). _Note: Super Admins have access to all network sites._
