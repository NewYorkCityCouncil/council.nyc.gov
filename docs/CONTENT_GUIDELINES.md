# Content Guidelines

We want to strengthen the relationship New Yorkers have with City Council through clearly organized, well designed, reader-friendly information. The goal is to depart from government-ese. You shouldn’t need a glossary of definitions to figure out what certain text means. Content should be concise and easy for all New Yorkers to understand. This guide outlines how to write in the voice of the Council. We focus on simple and succinct sentences, while avoiding governmental jargon.

## Voice and style

* Council aims to be clear and conversational, yet professional. To be as clear as possible, we strip sentences down to the **actors** and **actions**.  The use of **active voice** is preferred to **passive voice**.
    * Writers should always be conscious of the placement of the actors (or subjects) in their sentences. Write: *the Speaker proposed changes* instead of *the changes were proposed by the Speaker.*
    * Be conscious of the use of the verb “to be.” When the subject of your sentence comes after the verb, you are writing in **passive voice**.
    * Avoid citations. If needed, integrate into text (e.g. *according to the Department of City Planning*).
    * Alternate long and short sentences to help your writing flow better. Focus on one thought per sentence.
* Avoid **repeating words** in the same sentence to help with flow.

## Acronyms and Abbreviations

* Always spell out names of **agencies** and **organizations** on first reference, followed by the common abbreviation or acronym in parenthesis. On following references, the abbreviated agency name is preferred to the agency acronym. For instance, the **Department of Parks & Recreation** should be referred to on second reference as **Parks**, not **DPR**.
* Never abbreviate state names: Austen, Texas; Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
* Never abbreviate **Council Member** as **CM**.
* It’s acceptable to use **ampersands** and **percent signs** in subheadings, charts, graphs, and web buttons.

## Addresses

* Always use numerals when writing out building numbers in addresses.
* In reference to specific street names, always spell out and capitalize words like *Boulevard*, *Avenue* and *Street*. For street names that are also numbers, spell out and capitalize *First* through *Ninth* and use figures for *10th* and higher.
* If a street name includes a cardinal direction, abbreviate *North*, *South*, *East* and *West* only when referring to a specific building (e.g. *326 W. 17th Street*, or *East 34th Street*).

## Capitalization

* **Titles** should always be capitalized when they appear before a person’s name.
* Follow sentence case for **web buttons** that include three or more words. Use title case for buttons including one or two words. Punctuating buttons is up to the discretion of the writer.
* **Charter** should always be capitalized when used in reference to the New York City Charter.
* **Committee** should always be capitalized when referring to specific committee (e.g. *these committees*, or *the Land Use Committee*).
* **Council** should always be capitalized when referencing the New York City Council.
* **Council Member** should always be capitalized, as two separate words, when referencing New York City Council Members.
* **City** should be capitalized when referring to New York City.
* **District** should be capitalized when referring to New York City Council Districts (e.g. *the 11th Council District*, or *within several Council Districts*).
* **Speaker** should always be capitalized when used in reference to the Speaker of the New York City Council.
* **Mayor** should always be capitalized when used in reference to the Mayor of New York City.
* Capitalize the first word of a **Subheading**. Punctuating subheadings is acceptable for questions. Other forms of subhead punctuation is up to the discretion of the writer.
* Lowercase adjectives that describe status of a title (e.g. *The former Speaker Christine Quinn…*).

## Compositions

* Use quotation marks around titles of works of art and compositions, like books, songs, television shows, video games, and poems. Do not use quotations or italics for names of publications (e.g. “The Grapes of Wrath,” or The New York Times).

## Contractions

* Use common contractions like **isn’t**, **won’t**, and **you’ll** when possible. This sets a more conversational tone.

## Names

* Always use a person’s title, first and last name upon first reference. Use title and last name for following references. Do not use courtesy titles, unless needed to differentiate between people who have the same last name.
* On first reference, link Council Member names or Districts to the appropriate Council District page.

## Numbers

* Spell out numbers **one** through **nine**. Use numerals for numbers 10 and greater. Always spell out numbers that begin sentences, unless it’s a year (e.g. *2006 was a great year*). For numbers in the millions, billions or trillions, use a number and word (e.g. *1 billion*, *4.8 million*).
* When referring to **money**, always use numerals preceded with a dollar sign.  When referencing an amount of money less than $1, use numerals and spell out the word cents.
* For **dates**, avoid using ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, or 3rd). Always use figures (e.g. *March 7, 1980*).
* Always use numerals for **dimensions**. Spell out words like **pounds**, **feet**, and **ounces**.
* The word **percent** should almost always be written out. A percent sign (%) may be used for charts, graphs and subheads.
* Always use numerals for percentages (e.g. *30 percent*, *6 percent*).
* Use numerals in reference to **age**. Hyphenate ages when used as an adjective before a noun or in substitution for a noun (e.g. *the 20-year-old student*, or *the 8-year-olds*). Don’t use an apostrophe when describing a period of time (e.g. *in their 20s*, or *the 1950s*).

## Hyperlinks

* Avoid hyperlinking *read here*, or *click here*. Hyperlinked text should always be descriptive to give readers a solid understanding of the linked content.
* When linking out to content other than a web page, include file format in parenthesis after the linked text: the **Environmental Impact Statement (pdf)** or **Council Districts (map)**.

## Pronouns

Pronouns like **you** and **ours** should be used at the writer’s discretion to address readers or services Council is providing. This helps humanize the Council’s voice and makes us seem much more conversational and approachable.

## Punctuation

* **Apostrophes**: Add an apostrophe-s to all singular nouns, even if the noun ends in s. Use only an apostrophe with a singular noun if the following word begins with s (e.g. *the boss’s hat*, or *the boss’ style*). Only use an apostrophe for a proper noun that ends in s (e.g. *Districts’ residents*).
* **Bullets**: Capitalize the first word of every bullet. Include a period only when the bulleted item is a complete sentence.
* **Colons**: Capitalize the first after a colon if what follows makes a complete sentence.
* **Commas**: Always use the serial comma, also known as the Oxford comma.
* **Dashes**: **Em dashes** should be used–without spaces between them and adjacent words—to offset phrases. Avoid using **en dashes** when referring to ranges. Instead, spell out *to*, *and*, or *through*.
* **Dates**: Always use the full name of the month (e.g. *March 3, 2016*).
* **Quotation marks**: Periods and commas go inside quotation marks.

## Words to avoid

Strive to write with the fewest and simplest words possible. Avoid jargon and buzzwords with meanings that are lost on our readers. Opt instead for words that are more specific and descriptive. Here’s a list of words to avoid:

* Agenda (unless you’re talking about a meeting)
* Advancing
* Collaborate (use *working with*)
* Combating (use *working against* or *fighting*)
* Commit/pledge (we need to be more specific; we’re either doing something or we’re not)
* Countering
* Deploy (unless you’re talking about the military or software)
* Dialogue (we speak to people)
* Disincentivize (and incentivize)
* Empower
* Facilitate (instead, say something specific about how you are helping)
* Focusing
* Foster (unless it’s children)
* Illegals/illegal aliens (use *undocumented immigrants* or *persons without immigration status*)
* Impact (as a verb)
* Initiate
* Innovative (use words that describe the positive outcome of the innovation)
* Key (unless it unlocks something, a subject/thing isn’t *key*, it’s probably *important*)
* Land (as a verb; only use if you’re talking about aircraft)
* Leverage (unless you use it in the financial sense)
* Overarching
* Progress (what are you actually doing?)
* Promote (unless you are talking about an ad campaign or some other marketing promotion)
* Robust
* Simple/simply (use *straightforward*, *uncomplicated*, or *clear*, or leave the descriptor out altogether)
* Streamline
* Strengthening (unless you’re referring to bridges or other structures)
* Tackling (unless you’re referring to football or another contact sport)
* Thought leader (refer to a person’s accomplishments)
* Touchpoint (mention specific system components)
* Transforming (what are you actually doing to change it?)
* User testing (unless you’re actually testing the users; otherwise, use *usability testing*)
* Utilize

Avoid using figurative language. It often doesn’t say what you actually mean and can make your content more difficult to understand. Metaphors make translation more difficult. For example:

* Stand (used often in social movements, not inclusive of differently-abled people)
* Drive (you can only drive vehicles, not schemes or people)
* Drive out (unless it’s cattle)
* Going forward (unless you’re giving directions)
* In order to (this is superfluous; don’t use it)
* One-stop shop (we’re the government, not a big box store)
