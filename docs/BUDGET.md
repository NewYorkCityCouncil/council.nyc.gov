# Budget

The Budget Division has its own site in the WordPress multisite network. This is so that editors of Budget content do not have access to the content of other Divisions. This also simplifies the admin so that editors can more easily perform their tasks. The Budget site uses the "NYCC Budget" theme (`wp-nycc-budget`), a child theme of the "New York City Council" theme (`wp-nycc`).

_Note: Super Admins have access to all network sites_
